3. Launch eclipse and create a workspace.
4. Open a terminal, cd into your workspace and run this command to create the basic project: 

::

	mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=jersey-quickstart-grizzly2 -DarchetypeGroupId=org.glassfish.jersey.archetypes -DinteractiveMode=false -DgroupId=SampleService -DartifactId=Sample-Service -Dpackage=SampleService -DarchetypeVersion=2.17



5. In Eclipse, go to File->Import. Then open the Maven folder, and select "Existing maven projects". Browse to the folder that was just created in #4 and open the project
