Syllabus
==============

Welcome to COMP 339-439/Distributed Systems.

.. warning::

   This syllabus is in draft status. Nothing here will be official until well after August 15, 2013.

Synopsis
--------

This course is designed as a modern discussion of distributed computing
systems, which represents one of the most important areas in academic
and business computing today. Topics covered include distributed
computing, interactive services, collaborative computing, and
peer-to-peer sharing. Various distributed frameworks and technologies
will be explored, e.g. DNS, CORBA, Java RMI, SOAP (XML-based RPCs),
Message Passing Interface, and Globus. My version of this course also
aims to introduce students to research methods and has a substantial
written and oral communication component.

There is a substantial software development component in this course.
You are expected to be fluent in a modern object-oriented language (e.g.
Java, C#, C++, or Python). Java and XML will be presented at times
during lectures. You are expected to learn this material while doing the
warm-up programming exercises.

Prerequisites
-------------

Computer Science 271 (recursion and list/tree structures) knowledge will
be assumed for every student, including you. In particular you should
have deep knowledge of the following topics:

-  Core Data Structures: lists, trees, and maps. If you do not know
   these ideas from COMP 271 or equivalent, you will have a tough time
   in this course.
-  Object-Oriented Thinking: classes, objects, and the distinction
   between the two of of utmost importance. Knowledge of design
   patterns, while helpful, will be introduced as needed during the
   course.

Computer Science 313 (for design patterns knowledge) is required but
students who have strong background in data structures and/or prior
working knowledge of design patterns/object-oriented development may
continue in this course.

In any event, this course has significant architecture, design, systems,
and technical demands. You will likely need to supplement your knowledge
to flourish in the course.

Course Requirements and Grade Breakdown
---------------------------------------

This is subject to revision through the first week of classes only but
the percentages are unlikely to change significantly.

-  Design/Programming Assignments (10%)
-  Participation (10%)
-  Quiz-Exams (30%)

-  Significant Project (50%)

The following is an explanation of the course breakdown:

-  *Design/Programming Assignments* will involve working with XML and/or
   other programming languages and sometimes design tools (e.g. schema
   editors). This semester, all assignments may be done as a group of up
   to 3 people. In many cases, this might end up being your group for
   the semester project as well. Homework will be graded by a check-off
   process, meaning it is recorded as pass/fail. There will also be an
   expectation of weekly presentations about the homework, both in terms
   of strategies for solving the assignment and actual solutions.
-  *Quiz-Exams *\ will take on a new level of importance in the coming
   term. Quizzes will be used to determine whether you are keeping
   abreast of the lecture, reading, and assignments. While a mere 10% of
   your grade is at stake for each exam, you can expect these exams to
   be challenging if you are not staying on top of everything that is
   assigned. 
-  *Participation* will be determined based on your involvement in the
   class in concrete ways. For me, there are multiple ways I can measure
   your participation. The first is to be active in in-class discussions
   and make occasional presentations in class. Ideally, I expect every
   student to speak at least 1-3 times a semester, especially when it
   comes to the discussion of assignments. The second is to be active in
   the class discussion group. I'm particularly fond of participation
   that sheds new insight on material that we might not be able to cover
   in class and postings that are aimed at helping others.
-  *Projects *\ are obviously an important component of this course. I
   will be unveiling details about this during the 2nd week of classes.
   You should start thinking of potential ideas for projects and begin
   making acquaintances with others with the hope of forming a small
   team. Groups of 3 or fewer may propose a project idea at any time.
   Stay tuned for details.

Submitting Homework and Projects
--------------------------------

We will be using publicly available solutions for submitting XML and
other programming materials, including your project materials. So you
will not submit your code on Blackboard, which is not suitable for
submitting programming assignments in my experience.

For homework assignments, you are encouraged to use a solution that
allows you to keep your homework solution
completely \ *private*. `BitBucket  <http://bitbucket.org/>`_\ is an
excellent solution for this and allows you not only to keep your source
code on the site but also additional material, e.g. documentation (wiki
pages), etc., which normally accompanies a strong homework and/or
project submission.

For projects, you may use a public-hosting solution, especially if you
are considering the idea of working according to free/open source
principles. BitBucket is also a strong solution for publicly-hosted
projects. We also tend to be particularly fond of \ `Google
Code <http://code.google.com/hosting>`_ but will not limit you to this
way of thinking/expression. Regardless of what solution you choose,
every project is expected to maintain a source code repository and have
a public presence of one form or another and share it with the professor
(me). Consider using \ `Google Sites <http://sites.google.com/>`_ for a
basic web presence as well.

We will be discussing this issue in the first week of class. There is a
possibility that we'll have to tweak this section of the syllabus a bit
to find the "sweet spot" so to speak.

Attendance Policy
-----------------

I do not take attendance in class.

Attendance, however, is strongly encouraged. If you plan to miss class,
it is ok to let me know but, more importantly, please make sure you
speak with at least one other person in class to find out anything you
might have missed. Significant absences from class may hurt your
participation grade.

Late Work Policy
----------------

Beginning this term, late work will be accepted but at a slight penalty.
This penalty is best illustrated by example (A becomes A-, A- becomes
B+, B+ becomes B, etc.) Effectively, it's a one-stop penalty. The
assignment will be graded as if you had completed it on time, after
which the deduction will be applied. 

Late work will not be accepted for assignment N once assignment N+1's
due date has arrived. This means, in practice, that a zero will be
recorded for this assignment.

Quiz/Exam Attendance Policy
---------------------------

Quiz absences require advance notification and/or appropriate
documentation (e.g. doctor's note or documentation from Wellness
Center).

Failure to comply with this policy results in a zero.
