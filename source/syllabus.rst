Synopsis
--------

This course is designed as a modern discussion of distributed computing
systems, which represents one of the most important areas in academic
and business computing today. When you hear about *emerging* ideas, e.g.
service-oriented architecture and cloud computing, you are essentially
hearing about distributed systems by any other name.

In this offering, we'll explore (through lecture and class projects) 
current topics in distributed computing:  interactive services, collaborative computing,
peer-to-peer, grids, platforms and infrastructure as services (PaaS and IaaS),
cloud computing, etc.

In this course we will work on projects centered around realistic business use cases.


Prerequisites
-------------

Students in this course are expected to have a *minimum* of the following from their undergraduate experience:

- Operating Systems
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Competence in a high level programming language: Java, C#, or C++


Recommended Textbook
-----------------------

There are no *required* textbooks for this course. The hope is that you can learn 
everything you need to know through our lecture notes, supplemental readings (papers
and web resources), and various open source projects that employ distributed design
principles.

*Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design* by George Coulouris, Jean Dollimore, Tim Kindberg

*Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen

*Distributed Database Systems: 2nd edition or newer* by M. Tamer Osu and Patrick Valduriez


Class Assignments
-----------------
This class is a project oriented class. There will be no exams and no final. There will be no groups for these projects. All work will be individual.


Homework #1 Due Feb 15th
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - You will write a web application that works with an existing 3rd application framework and 3rd party data storage system.
 - For example:
	- An ASP.NET web application hosted in IIS with a SQL server database
	- A PHP web application hosted in Apache with a MySQL database
	- A RESTful web service that uses a MongoDB database
 - This system will involve one application host and one database host
 - This application should include basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations


Homework #2 Due March 15th
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - You will develop a client application that will put a very high load on the application built in Homework #1
 - Your goal should be to submit 100s - 1000s of requests per second to the application.
 - You will write a 4-5 page paper analyzing how your web application performs and where performance and reliability issues arise.
 - You will present this paper in class


Homework #3 Due April 15th
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - You will improve your application from Homework #1 to be a distributed system
 - Some suggested approaches include:
	- Database sharding
	- Database replication
	- Network load balancing
	- Introducing Hadoop into your application
	- Introducing MPI or Microsoft HPC into your application
 - You will re-run your benchmark from Homework #2
 - You will write a 4-5 page paper detailing how you were able to get better performance and reliability.
 - You will present this paper before class.


Attendance Policy
-----------------

I do not take attendance in class. If you anticipate a significant number of absences, I encourage you to consider dropping this course now and finding an alternative that better suits your schedule.

We will spend time in class discussing and working on homework and with the lecture material. Coming to class will help you to get the best grade.

Late Work Policy
----------------

Late submissions are accepted with a 20% grade penalty per week the assignment is late. Deadlines are strict.


Academic Integrity Policy
-------------------------

In general, we observe the College of Arts and Sciences integrity policy found at http://www.luc.edu/cas/pdfs/CAS_Academic_Integrity_Statement_December_07.pdf.
