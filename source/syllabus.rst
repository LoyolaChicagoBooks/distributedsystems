Synopsis
--------

This course is designed as a modern discussion of distributed computing
systems, which represents one of the most important areas in academic
and business computing today. When you hear about *emerging* ideas, e.g.
service-oriented architecture and cloud computing, you are essentially
hearing about distributed systems by any other name.

In this offering, we'll explore (through lecture and class projects) 
current topics in distributed computing:  interactive services, collaborative computing,
peer-to-peer, grids, platforms and infrastructure as services (PaaS and IaaS),
cloud computing, etc.

In this course we will work on projects centered around realistic business use cases.


Prerequisites
-------------

Students in this course are expected to have a *minimum* of the following from their undergraduate experience:

- Operating Systems
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Competence in a high level programming language: Java, C#, or C++


Recommended Textbook
-----------------------

There are no *required* textbooks for this course. The hope is that you can learn 
everything you need to know through our lecture notes, supplemental readings (papers
and web resources), and various open source projects that employ distributed design
principles.

*Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design* by George Coulouris, Jean Dollimore, Tim Kindberg

*Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen

*Distributed Database Systems: 2nd edition or newer* by M. Tamer Osu and Patrick Valduriez


Class Assignments
-----------------
This class is a project oriented class. There will be no exams and no final. There will be no groups for these projects. All work will be individual.


Attendance Policy
-----------------

I do not take attendance in class. If you anticipate a significant number of absences, I encourage you to consider dropping this course now and finding an alternative that better suits your schedule.

We will spend time in class discussing and working on homework and with the lecture material. Coming to class will help you to get the best grade.
