What is SMTP?

A protocol for sending email messages between servers. Most email systems send mail over the Internet using SMTP to send messages from one server to another, the messages can then be retrieved by an email client using POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol). It is also used to send messages from a mail client to a mail server.
