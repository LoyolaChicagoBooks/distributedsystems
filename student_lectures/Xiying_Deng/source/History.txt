The History and Future of GlusterFS
=====================================

History
---------
- Phases
 #. Lego Kit for Storage
	- Create a global namespace
	- Versions 1.x - 2.x
		- Hand-crafted volume definition files
		- Simple configuration files
 #. Repeatability of Use Cases
	- Community-led
	- Version 3.0
		- Adding, removing features
	- Version 3.1
		- Adding, removing volumes w/glustered
	- Version 3.2
		- Native NFS server
		- Marker framework
		- Geo-replication

- Gluster Production Deployments
	- BOX
	- NTT
	- SAMSUNG
	- PODIO
	- Cornell University
	- Stanford University
	- Deutsche Bank

- GlusterFS 3.3
	- New features
		- Unified File and Object access
		- Hadoop/HDFS compatibility
	- New volume type
		- Replicated + striped + distributed volumes
	- Enhancements to Distributed volumes
		- Rebalance can migrate open files
		- Remove-brick can migrate data to remaining bricks
	- Enhancements to replicated volumes
		- Change replica count on an active volume
		- add replication to distribute-only volumes
		- Much faster self-healing for large files

Future
------------
- Planning for GlusterFS 3.5
	- Core Features
		- AFR_CLI_enhancements
		- Better peer identification
		- Better ssl
		- Exposing volume capabilities
		- File snapshot
		- Object count
		- On-wire compression and decompression
		- Prevent NFS restart on volume change
		- Quota scalability
		- SELinux integration
		- Multi-Node test suite

- Technology Integrations
	- GlusterFS used as VM storage system
	- Shared storage ISOs and appliances
	- Goal: The standard for cloud storage
