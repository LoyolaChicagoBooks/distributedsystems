Introduction
-------------------------

	Not long ago, most web applications did not have a large number of users accessing them daily. In those times, having 1,000 users a day was considered to be a large userbase. As time passed, and more and more users gained Internet access, the number of users for popular web applications ballooned. Some web applications and services have millions of users per day. Modern web applications also keep much more detailed records of their users and their habits.
	
	Unfortunately, traditional relational databases are not well suited to handling large amounts of data in web and business applicatons. As a result, a new type of database technology is required to handle large amounts of data efficiently, one that did not use the old relational database model. These kinds of databases either don't use SQL at all, or if it was used, it was wrapped with other technologies to make the SQL console invisible to the user. As time progressed, many different kinds of 'NoSQL' databases emerged, distancing themselves from the relational database model.
