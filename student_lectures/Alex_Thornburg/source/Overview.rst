Overview
=======

BitCoin is a form of cryptographic currency developed by someone under the 
pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto.' BitCoin places importance on anonymity,
and a unique sense of “value.” 
In a complicated series of mining, 
encryption and network communication BitCoin creates a beautiful, 
decentralized, private, and highly accessible payment system for 
users all over the world. Though volatile, BitCoin has many wide ranging 
implication and the potential to keep nations afloat.

Advantages of BitCoin
--------------------------
Privacy

- BitCoin privacy is often hotly debated. Due to the necessity of a public ledger that insures no BitCoin is spent more than once users must remain anonymous.
- Nobody wants their transactions to be both public and tied to their name. Decentralization
- BitCoin is open source, so everyone with an internet connection can contribute.
- There is no Fed or Government to contribute to Economic volatility.

Disadvantages of BitCoin
--------------------------

Large Crime Base

- Anonymity is a double edged sword.
- The Silk Road largely used BitCoin for their transactions.
- Tumblers are able to launder BitCoin's quickly and effectively.

Not Widely Accepted

- There is a very small group of online merchants.

No Physical Form

- No central Fed or Gold to back the value.
- BitCoins establish value in the rarity of the hashes that are found through the mining process.

Aspects of BitCoin
-------------------
BitCoin's value comes from its rarity.

- Users must "Mine" BitCoin, which is an attempt to give it a quality similar to gold.
- People must break hashes spread over the web to add new BitCoins to the BlockChain - or public ledger.
- Mining gets more difficult as more blocks of hashes are added to the BlockChain. Payments
- Every users gets a wallet that consists of a private key.
- When a transaction is issued to someone else's private key it is signed and added to the BlockChain. The BlockChain insures the same BitCoin is not used more than once.

Mining

- Mining is a "distributed consensus system" that adds coins to the BlockChain.
- Miners must break a SHA-256 hash and the header of that hash must be lower than the target.
- The target is a hash that all bitcoins share and as more hashes are discovered, the target gets lower, thus making it more difficult to discover more bitcoins.
