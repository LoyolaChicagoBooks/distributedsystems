BlockChain
==========

Each block of coins contains every transaction ever made by that currency.

Block
-----

Each Block contains three things:

Header
------
The header of the last block. New headers must be generate under this header. The Headers are generated from the Merkle Hash Algorithm:

Magic Number
------------

- 4 bytes
- Value always 0xD9B4BE5

Blocksize
---------

-4 bytes
-Number of bytes following up to the end of the block

Transaction Counter

-positive integer VI = VarInt
-1-9 bytes

Transactions
------------

- The list of transactions

Here is a list of the blocks found: http://blockexplorer.com/

It is not distributed so we only need enough detail to 
understand mining and the transaction process.

Once a block is generated it is added to the chain of blocks that preceds it, and it becomes eligable for transaction.

The BlockChain is a series of blocks that are tied together in series. Here is the original image from Nakamotoâ€™s paper:
