Introduction
================

This is the new home for Dr. Thiruvathukal's COMP 339-439 course on 
Distributed Systems, which will replace the previous home at 
<http://distributed.etl.luc.edu>, which will be discontinued on September 1,
2013.

While not much is here at present, over the next few weeks, I will be 
migrating all of the content to Sphinx--a wonderful open source project
for writing user documentation that also doubles as a straightforward way
to write lecture notes and books. 

Stay tuned!
